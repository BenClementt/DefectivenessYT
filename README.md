<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm Jacques, but I'm also known as Hex or Jack. I'm a 15 year old Node.js developer who loves to code in their spare time.

## A couple projects I'm proud of
[Jinkaku](https://top.gg/bot/706271163168587848) - A discord bot for roleplayers<br>
[KeyFM](https://keyfm.net) - An online radio station<br>
Music4All - A discord bot which played music. My first ever Discord bot. Shutdown in 2018
